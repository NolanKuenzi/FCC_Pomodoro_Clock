==Description==

A basic timer that will go off once the set amount of time has elapsed. The timer includes start, stop, and reset features as well as the ability to switch between work sessions and break sessions.

This timer automatically alternates between work sessions and break sessions once the time for the current session has elapsed. The user can choose the length time for both work and break sessions.
